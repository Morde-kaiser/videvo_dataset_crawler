# videvo_dataset_crawler

Using requests, re, BeautifulSoup to crawl videos from videvo.net  
  You'd better use ipynb version by jupyter notebook cuz py file might crash due to requests connection lost  
	This program will automatically create a file called 'video', and all the videos would be downloaded there:)
